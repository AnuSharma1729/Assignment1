## q2
### time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: o(n)
#### It is not possible o achieve a time complexity of o(nlogn} with o(1) space, as the output requires the indices of the element which cannot be maintained without using extra space

## q3

### time complexity: O(n*(sum))
### space complexity: O(n*(sum))

### top down dp approach
